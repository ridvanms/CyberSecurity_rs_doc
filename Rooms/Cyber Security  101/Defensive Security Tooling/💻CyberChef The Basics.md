### Introduction
CyberChef is a simple, intuitive web-based application designed to help with various “cyber” operation tasks within your web browser. Think of it as a **Swiss Army knife** for data - like having a toolbox of different tools designed to do a specific task. These tasks range from simple encodings like **XOR** or **Base64** to complex operations like **AES encryption** or **RSA decryption**. CyberChef operates on **recipes**, a series of operations executed in order.

#### The Recipe Area

This is considered as the heart of the tool. In this area, you can seamlessly select, arrange, and fine-tune operations to suit your needs. This is where you take control, defining each operation's arguments and options precisely and purposefully. The recipe area is a designated space to select and arrange specific operations and then define their respective arguments and options to customize their behaviour further. In the recipe area, you can drag the operations you want to use and specify arguments and options.

Features include the following:

- `Save recipe`: This feature allows the user to save selected operations.
- `Load recipe`: Allows the user to load previously saved recipes.
- `Clear Recipe`: This feature will enable users to clear the chosen recipe during usage.

#### Input Area

The input area provides a user-friendly space where you can easily input text or files by pasting, typing, or dragging them to perform operations.

Additionally, it has the following features:

- `Add a new input tab`: This is where an additional tab is created for the user to use different values from the previous tab.

### Before anything else
Hold your horses!

Before even going to the actual thing, let's have a quick overview of the thought process when using CyberChef! This process consists of four different steps:

![This image illustrates the thought process when using CyberChef. The first box includes setting a clear objective and answering the question What do you want to achieve? The second box includes the steps you can do with your data. The third box includes which operations you might want to use. This can be a little bit tricky if you are not familiar with the data that you have. However, there are plenty of operations that we can choose from. The last box includes determining if the output is the desired one. If not, it states to repeat the process from the first box](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5e6bbe59a46ee9407fd65bbe/room-content/5e6bbe59a46ee9407fd65bbe-1726735685403.png)

Let's discuss each step further.

Setting a clear objective is essential. This step involves defining specific and achievable goals. It helps answer the question, "**What do I want to accomplish?**". Objectives are vital in providing direction, purpose, and focus to your goals. One example would be, "During a security investigation, I found a gibberish string; I want to know what hidden message it contains if it has one."

Next, put your data into the input area. In this step, you use your data. This is where you paste or upload the gibberish string that you found.

The third step is to select the **Operations** you want to use. This can be tricky if you are not familiar yet with what you are dealing with. Following our example, we are still determining what to use to understand this gibberish string. During our research, we found relevant information that this gibberish string might be using anything related to encryption. Therefore, we decided to use any operations under the **Encryption/Encoding** category, including but not limited to `ROT13`, `Base64`, `Base85`, or `ROT47`. Note that we can use a lot of operations under this category. 

Lastly, check the output to see if it is the intended result. This begs the question, "**Have we achieved our objective?**". In our example, it would mean, were we able to decode the gibberish string we found? If yes, then that's it! If not, we may need to repeat the steps that we have taken.

To provide visual clarity to our example, see the figure below:

![This image illustrates a more detailed thought process by including actual samples. The first box mentions that a gibberish string was found during a security incident. And we need to determine what the hidden message is. Next, we put the strings in our input area. Third, we need to determine which operations we can use through research and find any information that might be relevant. In our case, we discovered relevant information that encryption might be used, and we decided to use any operations under the Encryption/Encoding category. The last box asks if we could decode the hidden message; if not, we must repeat the process.](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5f9c7574e201fe31dad228fc/room-content/5f9c7574e201fe31dad228fc-1729242272295.png)

### Practice, Practice, Practice

## Extractors

The specific operations mentioned in the table below fall under the **Extractors** category.

|Specific|Description|
|---|---|
|Extract IP addresses|Extracts all IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.|
|Extract URLs|Extracts Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) from the input. The protocol (HTTP, FTP, etc.) is required, otherwise there will be far too many false positives.|
|Extract email addresses|Extracts all email addresses from the input.|

The `Extract IP addresses` will extract any valid IPv4/6 address from any given input. We recommend checking our existing room for a quick recap of networking: [Networking Concepts](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/networkingconcepts)

The `Extract email addresses` extracts any strings and characters with this format, anything@domain[.]com. Examples of domains include **hotmail.com**, **google.com**, **tryhackme.com**, and **yahoo.com**

`Extract URLs` extracts Uniform Resource Locator, commonly known as URL. , a URL is the address used to access resources on the internet. You can check the [Web Applications Basics](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/webapplicationbasics) room if you would like to dig deeper into URLs and web applications.

## Date and Time

The specific operations in the table below fall under the **Date / Time** category.

|Specific|Description|
|---|---|
|From UNIX Timestamp|Converts a UNIX timestamp to a datetime string.|
|To UNIX Timestamp|Parses a datetime string in UTC and returns the corresponding UNIX timestamp.|

A UNIX timestamp is a 32-bit value representing the number of seconds since January 1, 1970 UTC (the UNIX epoch). To convert "**Fri Sep 6 20:30:22 +04 2024**" into a UNIX Timestamp, use the operations `To UNIX Timestamp`, where the result would be `1725654622`. If you wish to convert it back to a more readable format, you can use `From UNIX Timestamp`.

## Data Format

The specific operations in the table below fall under the **Data format** category.

|Operations|Description|Examples|
|---|---|---|
|From Base64|This operation decodes data from an ASCII Base64 string back into its raw format.|`V2VsY29tZSB0byB0cnloYWNrbWUh` becomes `Welcome to tryhackme!`|
|URL Decode|Converts URI/URL percent-encoded characters back to their raw values.|`https%3A%2F%2Fgchq%2Egithub%2Eio%2FCyberChef%2F` becomes `https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/`|
|From Base85|notation for encoding arbitrary byte data. It is usually more efficient than Base64. This operation decodes data from an ASCII string (with an alphabet of your choosing, presets included).|`BOu!rD]j7BEbo7` becomes `hello world`|
|From Base58|is a notation for encoding arbitrary byte data. It differs from Base64 by removing efficiently misread characters (i.e. l, I, 0, and O) to improve human readability.|`AXLU7qR` becomes`Thm58`|
|To Base62|is a notation for encoding arbitrary byte data using a restricted set of symbols that humans can conveniently use and process by computers. The high number base results in shorter strings than with the decimal or hexadecimal system|`Thm62` becomes`6NiRkOY`|

Operations such as `Base(64, 85, 58, 62)` are known as **base encodings**. Base encoding takes binary data (strings of 0s and 1s) and transforms it into a text-based representation using a specific set of ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) characters.

Although we have a dedicated room for [Hashing Basics](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/hashingbasics), let's have a quick overview and discuss the most commonly used operation, `Base64`.

Our example would be to encode the letters "**THM**". We have a short ASCII Table here that we can use for reference. If you want to view the complete ASCII Table, please refer to this page [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII).

|Decimal|Binary|Symbol|-|Decimal|Binary|Symbol|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|65|01000001|A||78|01001110|N|
|66|01000010|B||79|01001111|O|
|67|01000011|C||80|01010000|P|
|68|01000100|D||81|01010001|Q|
|69|01000101|E||82|01010010|R|
|70|01000110|F||83|01010011|S|
|71|01000111|G||84|01010100|T|
|72|01001000|H||85|01010101|U|
|73|01001001|I||86|01010110|V|
|74|01001010|J||87|01010111|W|
|75|01001011|K||88|01011000|X|
|76|01001100|L||89|01011001|Y|
|77|01001101|M||90|01011010|Z|

  

## Step 1: Convert To Binary and Merge(Manually)

Based on our table above, **T = 01010100**, **H=01001000**, **M = 01001101**. Next, concatenate these binaries and make sure they have 24 characters. You should have `010101000100100001001101`

## Step 2: Divide and Convert to Decimal(Manually)

Separate `010101000100100001001101` into 6 characters each. You should have `010101` `000100` `100001` `001101`. These are 6-bit characters; we should have four instances of this now. We need to convert each instance to Decimal. Let's convert, then!

|Binary|Decimal (Base10)|
|---|---|
|010101|21|
|000100|4|
|100001|33|
|001101|13|

  

## Step 3: Convert to Base64 (Manually)

Now that we have the Numbers from the previous step, which are `21`, `4`, `33`, and `13`, let's look for the equivalent characters from our table below. This table represents a base64 index table.

|Index|Character|-|Index|Character|-|Index|Character|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|0|**A**||26|**a**||52|**0**|
|1|**B**||27|**b**||53|**1**|
|2|**C**||28|**c**||54|**2**|
|3|**D**||29|**d**||55|**3**|
|4|**E**||30|**e**||56|**4**|
|5|**F**||31|**f**||57|**5**|
|6|**G**||32|**g**||58|**6**|
|7|**H**||33|**h**||59|**7**|
|8|**I**||34|**i**||60|**8**|
|9|**J**||35|**j**||61|**9**|
|10|**K**||36|**k**||62|**+**|
|11|**L**||37|**l**||63|**/**|
|12|**M**||38|**m**||||
|13|**N**||39|**n**||||
|14|**O**||40|**o**||||
|15|**P**||41|**p**||||
|16|**Q**||42|**q**||||
|17|**R**||43|**r**||||
|18|**S**||44|**s**||||
|19|**T**||45|**t**||||
|20|**U**||46|**u**||||
|21|**V**||47|**v**||||
|22|**W**||48|**w**||||
|23|**X**||49|**x**||||
|24|**Y**||50|**y**||||
|25|**Z**||51|**z**||||

Upon checking from the table, we should have found its corresponding character by now. 

|Index|Characters|
|---|---|
|21|V|
|4|E|
|33|h|
|13|N|

Combine these characters, and you should have the equivalent of "THM" in base64 format. The answer would be `VEhN`.

Woah! Isn't that amazing? You just converted a set of characters into base64 manually.

Now, let’s discuss the `URL Decode`. This works by converting the percent-encoded characters back to their raw values. For a reference of these values, you can check the page [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding). Note that the default character set in HTML5 is **UTF-8**. Check the table below for a quick overview of what we can typically see in a URL.

|Characters|From UTF-8|
|---|---|
|:|%3A|
|/|%2F|
|.|%2E|
|=|%3D|
|#|%23|
