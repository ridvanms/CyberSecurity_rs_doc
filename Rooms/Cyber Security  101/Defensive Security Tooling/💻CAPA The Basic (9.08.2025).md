One of the challenges when analyzing potentially malicious software is that we risk our machine or environment being compromised when we run it unless we have a sandbox or a completely isolated environment where we can test all we want. Generally speaking, there are two types of analysis: dynamic analysis and static analysis. This room will focus on conducting static analysis using a tool called CAPA.

CAPA (Common Analysis Platform for Artifacts) is a tool developed by the FireEye Mandiant team. It is designed to **identify the capabilities** present in executable files like Portable Executables (PE), ELF binaries, .NET modules, shellcode, and even sandbox reports. It does so by analyzing the file and applying a set of rules that **describe common behaviours**, allowing it to determine what the **program is capable of doing**, such as **network communication**, **file manipulation**, **process injection**, and many more.

The beauty of CAPA is that it encapsulates years of reverse engineering knowledge into an automated tool, making it accessible even to those who may not be experts in reverse engineering. This can be incredibly useful for analysts and security professionals, allowing them to quickly understand potentially malicious software's functionality without manually reverse engineering the code.

This tool is particularly useful in malware analysis and threat hunting, where understanding a binary's capabilities is crucial for incident response and defensive measures.

  

### Learning Objectives

- Explore what CAPA is
- Learn how to use CAPA effectively
- Understand common fields and results rendered by using the tool
- Leverage the tool to Identify the program’s potential activity

### Tool Overview How CAPA works
Next is to make sure that you are in the correct directory (`C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\capa`); then you need to run `capa` or `capa.exe`, then point to the binary, and that’s it!

In this example, we will use **cryptbot.bin;** please note that the results of this file will be discussed throughout the succeeding task.

After running the command, wait for the result, which may take several minutes. **We don't intend this to finish but rather to let you get a feel for running the tool**, so we suggest that you continue the task while CAPA is running or stop the processing. There are alternative ways to proceed with the analysis of the results. See the command below.

Terminal

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\capa> capa.exe .\cryptbot.bin
loading : 100%|████████████████████| 485/485 [00:00<00:00, 1108.84     rules/s]
/ analyzing program...
```

  

In addition to the `-h` command, which gives us more information about the parameters available with the tool, we will use two (2) most used parameters, which is the `-v` and `-vv`, which will give us a more detailed result. However, this will increase the processing time. We will have a discussion about the results of these options in the coming tasks.

| Option                | Description                            | Sample Syntax                 |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `-h` or `--help`      | Show this help message and exit.       | `capa -h`                     |
| `-v` or `--verbose`   | Enable verbose result document.        | `capa.exe .\cryptbot.bin -v`  |
| `-vv` or `--vverbose` | Enable a very verbose result document. | `capa.exe .\cryptbot.bin -vv` |

#Answer the questions below

### Dissecting CAPA Results Part 1: General Information, MITRE and MAEC

As mentioned in the previous task, the results of running CAPA against cryptbot.bin  will be discussed in the succeeding task. As such, we will dissect the results per block and topic.

The first block contains basic information about the file. This includes the following:

- The cryptographic algorithms, such as the `md5`, and `sha1/256`.
- The `analysis` field tells us how CAPA performed its analysis on the file.
- The `os` field reveals the operating system (OS) context for which the identified capabilities apply.
- The `arch` field allows us to determine whether we are dealing with a binary related to x86 architecture.
- The `path` where the analyzed file was located.

#### MITRE ATT&CK

The MITRE ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) framework is a comprehensive global knowledge repository that meticulously documents the tactics and techniques employed by threat actors at every stage of a cyber-attack. It functions as a strategic playbook, providing detailed insights into attackers' methods, from **gaining initial access** to **maintaining a presence**, **escalating privileges**, **evading defenses**, **moving laterally within a network**, and much more. 

CAPA uses this format for the output. Note that some results may or may not contain the Technique and Sub-technique Identifier.

|Format|Sample|Explanation|
|---|---|---|
|**ATT&CK Tactic**::**ATT&CK Technique**::**Technique Identifier**|Defense Evasion::Obfuscated Files or Information::T1027|**DEFENSE EVASION =** ATT&CK Tactic  <br>**Obfuscated Files or Information =** ATT&CK Technique  <br>**T1027 =** Technique Identifier|

└──────────────────────┴───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

  
In CAPA's final output, they referenced the MITRE Framework. This helps analysts or defenders map the file's behaviour to the adversary's playbook, which can help narrow down the scope of the investigation during an incident. To dig deeper into this topic, you might want to check out our room for [MITRE ATT&CK Framework](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/mitre).  

####   MAEC

**Malware Attribute Enumeration and Characterization** is a specialized language designed to encode and communicate complex details concerning malware. It contains an extensive range of attributes, including behaviours, artefacts, and interconnections among various instances of malware. This language functions as a standardized system for tracking and analyzing the complicated complexities of malware.

Malware Attribute Enumeration and Characterization

```powershell
┌─────────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ MAEC Category               │ MAEC Value                                                         │
├─────────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ malware-category            │ launcher                                                           │
└─────────────────────────────┴────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

  

Let’s check the table below to see the most commonly used MAEC values by CAPA: **Downloader** and **Launcher**.

|**MAEC Value**|Description|
|---|---|
|Launcher|Exhibits behaviours that trigger specific actions similar to malware behaviour.|
|Downloader|Exhibits behaviours wherein it downloads and executes other files, usually seen on more complex malware.|

  

When CAPA tags a file with a “**launcher**” MAEC value, it indicates that the file demonstrates behaviour similar to but not limited to:

- Dropping additional payloads
- Activating persistence mechanisms
- Connecting to command-and-control (C2) servers
- Executing specific functions

This is interesting! Some of these behaviours are also present in the Malware Behavior Catalogue (MBC)  and Capability block, which we will discuss in the next task!


### Dissecting CAPA Results Part 2: Malware Behavior Catalogue
In this task, we will cover the following topics:  

- #MBC
- #Objective
- #Micro-Objective
- #MBC Behaviors
- #Micro-Behavior
- #Methods

#### Malware Behavior Catalogue (MBC)

MBC is designed to support various aspects of malware analysis, such as labelling, similarity analysis, and standardized reporting. Essentially, it serves as a catalogue of malware objectives and behaviours. MBC can also link to ATT&CK methods and log all behaviours and code features discovered during malware analysis. It's important to note that the names of MBC behaviours may or may not match the corresponding ATT&CK techniques. The information on behaviour pages complements the content on ATT&CK pages. In other words, when recording malware behaviours, MBC users will reference ATT&CK, but MBC does not duplicate ATT&CK information.

The content of MBC below can be represented in two formats.

|Format|Sample|Explanation|
|---|---|---|
|**OBJECTIVE**::**Behavior**::**Method**[**Identifier**]|ANTI-STATIC ANALYSIS::Executable Code Obfuscation::Argument Obfuscation [B0032.020]|**Anti-static Analysis** = OBJECTIVE  <br>**Executable Code Obfuscation** = BEHAVIOR  <br>**Argument Obfuscation** = METHOD  <br>**BOO32.020** = IDENTIFIER|
|**OBJECTIVE**::**Behavior**::[**Identifier**]|COMMUNICATION::HTTP Communication:: [C0002]|**COMMUNICATION** = OBJECTIVE  <br>**HTTP Communication** = BEHAVIOR  <br>**C0002** = IDENTIFIER|

The difference between the two formats is that the first format contains additional details called METHOD, which can also be coined as a sub-technique.

  

We must also discuss the Objective, Behavior, and Methods to better understand this part.

  

### Objective

The Objective are based on **ATT&CK tactics in the context of malware behaviour**, though not all are included. Furthermore, MBC has Anti-Behavioral and Anti-Static Analysis. These objectives are tailored for malware analysis with the use case of **characterizing malware**. See the table below for an explanation of each.

|**Objective**|**Explanation**|
|---|---|
|**Anti-Behavioral Analysis**|Malware attempts to avoid detection by hindering behavioural analysis using tools like sandboxes or debuggers.|
|**Anti-Static Analysis**|Malware attempts to obstruct or add complexity to static analysis, making it more challenging for security professionals to identify and understand its malicious behaviours and intentions.|
|**Collection**|Malware focuses on identifying and gathering information from the targeted machine or network.|
|**Command and Control**|Malware typically establishes communication with compromised systems through various methods such as command and control servers, peer-to-peer networks, or other means. This communication allows the malware to control the compromised systems, enabling the attackers to execute commands, exfiltrate data, or carry out other malicious activities.|
|**Credential Access**|The primary aim of malware is to steal account credentials, such as usernames and passwords.|
|**Defense Evasion**|The malware aims to bypass and circumvent the various detection and security mechanisms present within the system to avoid being detected or mitigated.|

**View More Objective**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Discovery**|Malware Seeks to collect detailed information about the configuration and setup of the system or network environment, including hardware, software, and network infrastructure.|
|**Execution**|Malware is designed to execute unauthorized commands or code on a targeted computer system without the user’s consent. This can include a wide range of harmful activities, such as stealing personal information, damaging files, or gaining unauthorized access to the system.|
|**Exfiltration**|Malware is designed to infiltrate computer systems or networks to steal and extract sensitive data. This can include personal information, financial details, and any other valuable data stored on the targeted system or network.|
|**Impact**|Malware aims to manipulate, disrupt, or damage computer systems and data. It can enter computers through infected emails, compromised websites, and other deceptive means, leading to financial loss, privacy breaches, and system instability.|
|**Lateral Movement**|Malware seeks to spread through the network, either actively through machine access or passively, such as via malicious emails.|
|**Persistence**|Malware is intentionally developed with the capability to remain undetected and operational on a computer system for an extended period.|
|**Privilege Escalation**|Malware seeks to infiltrate a computer system or network to gain elevated permissions or control. Once inside the target environment, malware can seek to escalate its privileges, access sensitive information, or take control of system resources for malicious purposes.|

  

### Micro-Objective  

 Micro-objectives are associated with micro-behaviors, which refer to an action or actions exhibited by potentially malicious software that isn't necessarily malicious and may serve various objectives. Example binaries are such as those in messaging apps. However, it's important to **note that these behaviours are typically abused.** That's why CAPA might have flagged this behaviour.

|**Micro-Objective**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**PROCESS**|exhibiting behaviours related to processes such as but not limited to Creating Process, Setting Thread Context, Terminating Process, and Checking Mutex.|
|**MEMORY**|exhibiting behaviours such as, but not limited to, Allocating Memory, Changing Memory Protection, and Freeing Memory.|
|**COMMUNICATION**|exhibiting behaviours such as (not limited to (DNS, FTP, HTTP, ICMP, SMTP) network traffic.|
|**DATA**|exhibiting behaviours such as but not limited to Checking strings, compressing, decoding and encoding data|

  
The final output of CAPA, Objective, and Micro-Objective are shown only under the **Objective column**.

###   

### MBC Behaviors

The column MBC Behaviors contains behaviours and Micro-behaviors with or without its methods and identifiers. Please check the link [MBC Summary](https://github.com/MBCProject/mbc-markdown/blob/main/mbc_summary.md) for a listing of all MBC content.

Below is a compiled version of Behaviors/Micro-behaviors and its Identifier.

|**Objective**|**Behavior**|Identifiers|Explanation|
|---|---|---|---|
|ANTI-BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS|**Virtual Machine Detection**|**B0009**|The malware checks to see if it is running in a virtual environment. During its system reconnaissance, the malware examines various user and system artifacts.|
|ANTI-STATIC ANALYSIS|**Executable Code Obfuscation**|**B0032**|Executable code has been intentionally obscured to prevent static code analysis. This is a specific behavior related to the executable code of a malware sample, including its data and text sections.|
|EXECUTION|**Command and Scripting Interpreter**|**E1059**|Malware can exploit command and script interpreters to run malicious commands, scripts, or binaries. It targets built-in interpreters like cmd.exe or PowerShell on Windows or Bash on Unix-like systems. Attackers may also use other scripting languages like Python, Perl, or JavaScript.|
|DISCOVERY|**File and Directory Discovery**|**E1083**|Malware has the capability to search for specific files in particular locations by enumerating files and directories.|
|ANTI-STATIC ANALYSIS, DEFENSE EVASION|**Obfuscated Files or Information**|**E1027**|Malware can obfuscate files or information by encoding, encrypting, or otherwise, making them hard to analyze. It can also encode or encrypt malware samples itself.|

###   

### Micro-Behavior

The term "low-level behaviors" in malware analysis refers to actions exhibited by malware that aren't necessarily malicious and may serve various objectives. These behaviors are often documented as "micro-behaviors" in the Malware Behavior Characteristics (MBC) analysis. Examples of such low-level behaviors include the creation of TCP sockets and evaluating specific conditions within strings. It's important to **note that just because a behavior is categorized as low-level does not mean it is harmless,** as it may still be part of a larger malicious scheme.

|**Micro-Objective**|**Micro-Behaviors**|Identifiers|Explanation|
|---|---|---|---|
|MEMORY|**Allocate Memory**|**C0007**|Malware frequently utilizes memory allocation as part of its strategy to unpack itself and execute its malicious activities.|
|PROCESS|**Create Process**|**C0017**|Malware creates a process via WMI or shellcode. It can also create a suspended process.|
|COMMUNICATION|**HTTP Communication**|**C0002**|Malware is capable of initiating HTTP communications.|
|DATA|**Check String**|**C0019**|Malware can inspect a string to identify specific characteristics, such as ASCII content, credit card numbers, and string length.|

**View More Tables**

| DATA        | **Encode Data**      | **C0026** | Malware has the capability to encode data using base64 and XOR. |
| ----------- | -------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| FILE SYSTEM | **Create Directory** | **C0046** | Malware can create a directory.                                 |
| FILE SYSTEM | **Delete File**      | **C0047** | Malware has the capability to delete a file.                    |
| FILE SYSTEM | **Read File**        | **C0051** | Malware can read a file.                                        |
| FILE SYSTEM | **Writes File**      | **C0052** | Malware has the capability to write to a file.                  |

  

Note that in the final output of CAPA, Behavior and Micro-Behavior are shown only under the **Behavior column**.  

###   

### Methods

Lastly, let’s check the **METHODS**. Below are some methods included in the results from the previous sample. Methods are tied to behaviors; therefore, to fully see all methods, please refer to each specific behavior/micro behavior of interest.

|Behavior|Methods or sub-technique|Identifier|Explanation|
|---|---|---|---|
|Executable Code Obfuscation|**Argument Obfuscation**|B0032.020|Simple number or string arguments to API calls are calculated at runtime, making analysis more difficult.|
|Executable Code Obfuscation|**Stack Strings**|B0032.017|Build and decrypt strings on the stack at each use, then discard to avoid obvious references.|
|HTTP Communication|**Read Header**|C0002.014|HTTP read header.|
|Encode Data|**Base64**|C0026.001|Malware may encode data using Base64.|
|Encode Data|**XOR**|C0026.002|Malware may use XOR to encode data.|
|Obfuscated Files or Information|**Encoding-Standard Algorithm**|E1027.m02|Encoding malware samples, files, or other information uses a standard algorithm (e.g., base64).|

|Label|Value|Explanation|
|---|---|---|
|MBC Objective|**DATA**|exhibiting behaviors such as, but not limited to, checking strings, compressing, decoding, and encoding data.|
|MBC Behavior|**Encode Data**|Malware has the capability to encode data using base64 and XOR.|
|Method|**Base64**|Malware may encode data using Base64.|
|Identifier|**C0026.001**|identifier relays information about a behavior. This also serves as a tag.|

The content of this block is represented in the below format.  

|Format|Sample|Explanation|
|---|---|---|
|**Capability(Rule Name)**::**TLN(Top-Level Namespace)**/**Namespace**|reference anti-VM strings::Anti-Analysis/anti-vm/vm-detection|**Reference anti-VM strings** = Capability(Rule Name)  <br>**Anti-Analysis** = TLN or Top-Level Namespace  <br>**anti-vm/vm-detection** = Namespace|

  

### Namespaces

CAPA uses namespaces to group items with the same purpose. 

|Top-Level Namespace (TLN)|Explanation|
|---|---|
|anti-analysis|contains a set of rules specifically designed to detect behaviours exhibited by malware to evade analysis. These behaviours include obfuscation, packing, and anti-debugging techniques.|
|collection|contains a set of data-related rules that malware may enumerate and collect for exfiltration or other purposes. Think of it as the “data-gathering” aspect of malware behaviour.|
|communication|contains a set of rules that pertain to different communication behaviours demonstrated by malware. This encompasses how malware interacts with networks, including data transmission and reception, command and control communications, and other network-related behaviours.|
|compiler|contains a set of rules and configurations for recognizing specific build environments or compilers employed in generating executables. These namespaces essentially serve as the unique “signature” that identifies the compilation process of a program.|
|data-manipulation|contains a set of rules that govern the behaviours involved in altering data within executable files. This aspect can be considered the “data transformation” component of malware behaviour, encompassing actions such as String Encryption and Data Encoding.|

|executable|contains a set of rules pertaining to the attributes in executable files. These attributes include PE sections or debug info associated with the executable.|
|host-interaction|contains a set of rules related to behaviors involving interactions with the host system. This encompasses how malware interacts with its environment. Specifically, the rules in this namespace may capture behaviors related to reading, writing, or modifying files on disk, including creating, deleting, or modifying files and directories.”|
|impact|contains a set of rules related to the potential consequences or effects of a program’s behavior. Think of it as the aspect that focuses on the possible harm that this malware can cause. It may include behaviors related to establishing remote access, data exfiltration, destruction, or modification.”|
|internal|Rules contained within the system are not intended for direct use by analysts or for reporting. Instead, these rules are meant for internal purposes within the CAPA tool, serving as the behind-the-scenes aspect of rule development and execution.|
|lib|building blocks to create other rules|
|linking|contains rules to identify behaviors involving linking or dynamically loading external code or libraries during program execution. This is its primary function and is crucial for the program’s security. Understanding linking behavior is essential for several reasons. Malware often depends on external libraries or components (such as OpenSSL, Zlib, or other third-party libraries) to carry out specific tasks. Detecting these dependencies helps analysts understand the malware’s capabilities. External libraries also introduce an additional attack surface. If a vulnerability exists in a linked library, it can be exploited by the malware or defenders during analysis.|
|load-code|contains a set of rules and regulations related to the behaviors associated with dynamically loading or executing code during program execution. This concept can be equated to the “runtime code injection” aspect of malware behavior, which involves unauthorized code introduction during a program’s execution.|
|malware-family|contains a set of rules related to behaviors that are linked to particular malware families or groups. It serves as a way to identify the distinct characteristics or “signatures” associated with known malware families, allowing for more accurate detection and classification of potential threats.|
|nursery|this is a staging ground that contains rules for those who are not quite polished|
|persistence|contains rules related to behaviors associated with maintaining access or persistence within a compromised system. This namespace is essentially focused on understanding how malware can establish and maintain a presence within a compromised environment, allowing it to persist and carry out malicious activities over an extended period.|
|runtime|contains a set of rules that seek to identify the language or platform on which the program runs.|
|targeting|contains a set of rules related to behaviors exhibited by programs that interact with ATMs.|

  

Let’s see how this works by checking the table below.  

|Top-Level Namespace (TLN)|Namespaces|Rule YAML File|Explanation|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Anti-Analysis**|anti-vm/vm-detection|reference-anti-vm-strings-targeting-virtualbox.yml  <br>  <br>reference-anti-vm-strings-targeting-virtualpc.yml|“anti-vm/vm-detection” namespace contains rules to detect virtual machine (VM) environments. These rules focus on identifying specific strings or patterns commonly used by malware to detect VMs while running. Using these rules, CAPA can identify if malware searches for VMware-specific registry keys, the presence of VMware tools, or other VM-related elements.|
||obfuscation|obfuscated-with-dotfuscator.yml  <br>  <br>obfuscated-with-smartassembly.yml|Malware often uses obfuscation techniques to make analysis more difficult. These include methods such as String Encryption, Code Obfuscation, Packing, and Anti-Debugging Tricks. The obfuscation namespace addresses these techniques, which conceal or obscure the true purpose of the code.|

For this, we only used **Anti-Analysis** as the TLN or Top-Level Namespace. Under this TLN, we have grouped namespaces, such as **anti-vm/vm-detection** and **obfuscation**. Each namespace has a collection of rules inside them that are also grouped together. For **anti-vm/vm-detection,** we have rules, and it's config file, such as:

- **reference-anti-vm-strings-targeting-virtualbox.yml**
- **reference-anti-vm-strings-targeting-virtualpc.ym**l

The same goes for the **obfuscation** namespace. We have rules that are grouped, such as:

- **obfuscated-with-dotfuscator.yml**
- **obfuscated-with-smartassembly.yml**

Again, do note that this is still under TLN **Anti-Analysis**!

Please also refer to the illustration below.

In addition to what was mentioned in the above table, there are still a few more namespaces under **Anti-Analysis** with corresponding rules. If you want to dig deeper, please check this [link](https://github.com/MBCProject/capa-rules-1/tree/master/anti-analysis).

Use this [link](https://github.com/MBCProject/capa-rules-1?tab=readme-ov-file#namespace-organization) if you are interested in the other TLN or Top-Level Namespaces, such as collection, compiler, persistence, linking, and impact.

### Dissecting CAPA Results Part 4: Capability
In this task, we will continue the discussion from the previous task.

|---|---|---|---|---|

  

To further explain this, let’s check the first capability on the table, “**reference anti-VM strings”**.

- We note that the related rules in YML format are **reference-anti-vm-strings.yml**
- This is under the namespace **anti-vm/vm-detection**
- which is also under the Top-Level Namespace **Anti-Analysis**

This tells us that CAPA was able to identify that the potentially malicious software **searches for VMware-specific registry keys**, the **presence of VMware tools**, or other **VM-related elements** by using the **reference-anti-vm-strings.yml** rule yaml file. Malware typically does this behaviour to avoid detection. That is why CAPA flagged this one.

Let’s have another example. Let’s look at "_**schedule task via schtasks**_"_._

- We note that the related rules in YML format is **schedule-task-via-schtasks.yml***
- This is under the namespace **scheduled-tasks**
- which is also under the Top-Level Namespace **persistence**

This tells us that CAPA could identify behaviours related to scheduled tasks within the Windows operating system. It might have recognized patterns indicating that the executable registers itself as a scheduled task to maintain persistence using the rule defined in **schedule-task-via-schtasks.yml.**

Hold on! Have you noticed something?

That’s right! The item under Capability has the same name as the YML files under the Rules, with the addition of a dash (-) character between spaces! Simple because Capability is the name of the rule.

Now, we want to take note of some exceptions here. Where the Capability or rules are not located under its Namespace, let’s take the Capability **reference cryptocurrency strings** from the table above; this should be under the **Impact** Top-Level Namespace, right? However, if you go through the folders, you won’t be able to find the corresponding rules. It will be located under the **Nursery** TLN. This is the placeholder for rules that are not quite polished yet.

Now that we have a good overview and understanding of the Capability and Namespace contents, we should be able to explain the sample result from the previous tasks. Therefore, let’s do a quick recap using one of the results. Shall we?

Malware Behavior Catalogue

```powershell
┌───────────────────────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Capability                                │ Namespace                                 │
├───────────────────────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ reference Base64 string                   │ data-manipulation/encoding/base64         │
└───────────────────────────────────────────┴───────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

  

Here's the explanation for the above result. See the table below.

|Label|Value|Explanation|
|---|---|---|
|Capability|**reference base64 string**|Malware has the capability to encode data using a base64 scheme.|
|Top-Level Namespace|**data-manipulation**|contains a set of rules that govern the behaviors involved in altering data within executable files. This aspect can be considered the “data transformation” component of malware behaviour, encompassing actions such as String Encryption and Data Encoding.|
|Namespace|**encoding/base64**|this namespace consists of rules for encoding and decoding data using Base64 and XOR|
|Rule YAML File Matched?|**reference-base64-string.yml**|Remember that the capability's name is also the rule's name with an additional dash (-) character between spaces.|

Knowing this information, you may say this file can use the base64 encoding scheme!  

  

Now we’re done dissecting the results from the sample run from the previous task!

#Answer the questions below:

What **rule yaml file** was matched if the Capability or rule name is **check HTTP status code**?
- 
What is the **name of the Capability** if the rule YAML file is `reference-anti-vm-strings.yml`?
- 
Which **TLN** or Top-Level Namespace includes the Capability or rule name **run PowerShell expression**?
- 
Check the conditions inside the `check-for-windows-sandbox-via-registry.yml` rule file from this [link](https://github.com/MBCProject/capa-rules-1/blob/master/anti-analysis/anti-vm/vm-detection/check-for-windows-sandbox-via-registry.yml). What is the **value of the API** that ends in `Ex` is it looking for?
- 

### More Information, more fun!
Aren't you curious about what precisely within the rule was matched? Well, I am!

In this task, we will seek to determine the reason for triggering the rules and the conditions involved. We will use the parameter `-vv`  or **very verbose** to achieve this.

|Option|Description|Sample Syntax|
|---|---|---|
|`-v` or `--verbose`|enable verbose result document|`capa.exe -v .\cryptbot.bin`|
|`-vv` or `--vverbose`|enable very verbose result document)|`capa.exe -vv .\cryptbot.bin`|

  

Let's run it!

Terminal

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\capa> capa -vv .\cryptbot.bin
loading : 100%|████████████████████| 485/485 [00:00<00:00, 1108.84     rules/s]
/ analyzing program...
```

This will give us more detailed results; however, this will take a lot of time. We already processed this and named the file `cryptbot_vv.txt` in "`C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\capa`". Remember, you don't need to wait for the tool to finish running; we did this so that you can get a feel for running the tool and experiment with its parameters.

Open another PowerShell terminal and look inside the file using the command `Get-Content cryptbot_vv.txt`.

Terminal

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\capa> Get-Content .\cryptbot_vv.txt
```

So, have you opened the file? Do you have more than three thousand lines similar to this one?

Accessing this vast amount of information using a terminal or a text editor will be challenging.

To analyze this result with ease, we need to do two things. First, we will use the parameter `-j` and `-vv`, and direct the result to a **.json** file. The command would be `capa.bin -j -vv .\cryptbot.bin > cryptbot_vv.json`

.  

Terminal

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\capa> capa.bin -j -vv .\cryptbot.bin > cryptbot_vv.json
loading : 100%|████████████████████| 485/485 [00:00<00:00, 1108.84     rules/s]
/ analyzing program...
```

Again, this will take a lot of time, similar to the previous commands we run. We have processed this and created a file named  **cryptbot_vv.json** located in "**C:\Users\****Administrator\Desktop\capa**".  Additionally, we've attached the file to this task. Remember, you don't need to wait for the tool to finish running; we did this so that you can get a feel for running the tool and experiment with its parameters. 

We can start with our next step.

  

CAPA Web Explorer  

The second thing we need to do is upload the file to **CAPA Explorer Web**. We can either use their online version here on this [link](https://mandiant.github.io/capa/explorer/#/), or the offline version already in the virtual machine. There is a Google Chrome browser on the desktop named **capa_web_explorer_offline.html**. Alternatively, you can access this using a regular Chrome browser bookmark. Note that the local page may take up to a minute to load in Chrome on the target machine.  

![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5e6bbe59a46ee9407fd65bbe/room-content/5e6bbe59a46ee9407fd65bbe-1726485147188.png)

Now, we should have access to the homepage!

Look for the button **Upload from local** located at the bottom left of the page and select the file **cryptbot_vv.json** in **C:\Users\****Administrator\Desktop\capa**. Once uploaded, you should have a similar output. 

![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5e6bbe59a46ee9407fd65bbe/room-content/5e6bbe59a46ee9407fd65bbe-1726486090871.png)  

Doesn't this look good and easier to use? I bet it is!

  

Now, it's time to explore this excellent addition to the tool. We'll review some capabilities and check what precisely within the rule was matched. This will give us a better idea of how the rule works.

Let's go through our first example below. We know that the capability was to **reference anti-VM strings targeting VMWare,** and the corresponding rule config file or yaml file is **anti-VM-Strings-targeting-VMWare.yml.** Notice the box from the image.  

![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5e6bbe59a46ee9407fd65bbe/room-content/5e6bbe59a46ee9407fd65bbe-1726487492872.png)  

 Then, let us show you an overview of the rule's content. Focus on the **features** as CAPA uses the succeeding strings below to check if strings are within the analyzed file. 

**View Rule**

  

Did you see it? That's right! Under the features, the "**string: /VMWare/i"** is being referenced by CAPA Web Explorer. Simply, CAPA is saying that under this namespace, we could identify strings with a value of **VMWare** by using the conditions within the rule and with regex**.**

  
Let's have another sample.  We know that the capability was to reference the **scheduled task via schtasks**, and the corresponding rule was to schedule the **task via schtasks****.yml.** Notice the box from the image.

![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5e6bbe59a46ee9407fd65bbe/room-content/5e6bbe59a46ee9407fd65bbe-1726488911179.png)  

The same applies to our first example; we will show you the rule's content overview. Focus on the features, as CAPA uses the succeeding strings below to check if there are strings within the file being analyzed.

Terminal

```powershell
rule:
  meta:
    name: schedule task via schtasks
    namespace: persistence/scheduled-tasks
    authors:
      - 0x534a@mailbox.org
    scopes:
      static: function
      dynamic: thread
    att&ck:
      - Persistence::Scheduled Task/Job::Scheduled Task [T1053.005]
    examples:
      - 79cde1aa711e321b4939805d27e160be:0x401440
  features:
    - and:
      - match: host-interaction/process/create
      - or:
        - and:
          - string: /schtasks/i
          - string: /\/create /i
        - string: /Register-ScheduledTask /i
```

Under the feature, the "**string: /schtasks/i** and **/\/create /i"** is referenced by CAPA Web Explorer. Simply, CAPA is saying under this namespace, and by using the conditions within the rule and with regex, we could identify strings with a value of **schtasks** and **create**. 

###   

### Global Search Box

Another cool feature of this tool is its filter options and the Global Search box, which are very helpful.

![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5e6bbe59a46ee9407fd65bbe/room-content/5e6bbe59a46ee9407fd65bbe-1726489697099.png)

  

We could quickly examine this overwhelming information using CAPA Web Explorer compared to any text editor.
